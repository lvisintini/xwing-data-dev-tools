# TODO RULEBOOK
- Rules should have a type: Rule (default), Rule clarification, Card Clarification, Example, Fact
- Related topics are Related rules that have 'Rule' as type.
- Examples are related rules that have "example" as type
- Rule Clarifications are rules that clarify the interaction between rules: they are related rules that have clarification as types.
- Card Clarifications are rules that have the type "card clarification", and it is and its tied to a card details.

- Rules may have a format: a text field that outline how to print all the clauses. this can be usefull for diagrams
If not present, do nothing and just print the markdown.
If present, a format should have a way to populate `rendered` data within a structure, that can be later feed to mermaid.
we could user mermaid in the website to generate the graph
we can later use the component
